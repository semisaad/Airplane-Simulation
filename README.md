# Airplane Simulation

Airplane Simulation is a lightweight 3D flight simulation system that demonstrates basic flight dynamics, realistic terrain rendering, and interactive camera controls. Itâ€™s designed as a project to explore simulation, graphics rendering, and simple physics in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **3D Flight Simulation:** Experience basic flight dynamics including pitch, roll, and yaw.
- **Realistic Terrain:** Renders detailed terrains with custom textures.
- **Camera System:** Multiple camera views to follow the aircraft or explore the environment.
- **Custom Models & Textures:** Includes a 3D airplane model and associated assets.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Built to run efficiently with modern rendering techniques.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (or your chosen graphics library) installed on your system.
- Git (to clone the repository)
